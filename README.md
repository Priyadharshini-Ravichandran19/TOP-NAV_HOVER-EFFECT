This File content is only made with HTML And CSS only which depicts the usage of HOVER EFFECT(the primary most thing in all webs)
A hover effect is a way of changing the appearance or behavior of an element when the user moves the mouse over it. Some of the points about the hover effect are:

It is achieved by using the :hover pseudo-class selector in CSS, which matches elements that are in a hovered state.
It can be used to create interactive and engaging effects, such as changing the color, size, shape, or position of an element, or revealing hidden content or information.
It can be applied to any element, not just links, but it should be used with care and moderation, as too many hover effects can be distracting or confusing for the user.
It can be combined with other CSS properties, such as transitions, animations, transforms, filters, or clip-path, to create smooth and dynamic effects.
